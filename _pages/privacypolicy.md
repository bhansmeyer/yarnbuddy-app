# Privacy Policy

YarnBuddy does not collect any of your data, period. Everything that you enter into the app, including all projects, notes, and yarn, is stored locally on your device and synced between devices using iCloud. YarnBuddy does not display any advertisements, use any trackers or analytics, or send anything to any server.

If you choose to import pattern PDFs from Ravelry, YarnBuddy is able to securely link to your Ravelry account without ever gaining access to your username and password using a standard authorization framework called OAuth 2.0. You always have full control and can revoke YarnBuddy's access to your Ravelry library's PDFs at any time.
