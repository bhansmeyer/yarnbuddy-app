### About YarnBuddy

YarnBuddy is a row counter and project tracker for knitters and crocheters. Its delightful, clutter-free design helps crafters focus on the project at hand and its unique, collapsible drawer of customizable row counters provides a powerful way to keep track of their spot in a pattern. YarnBuddy is well-suited for fiber artists of all experience levels and includes tools for looking up common abbreviations found in patterns, converting between metric and imperial units, calculating yarn substitutions, and more. It also has a built-in yarn inventory system for keeping track of purchased yarn.

YarnBuddy is available on iOS, iPadOS, and watchOS. It has a beautiful, 3-column design on iPad, uses the new system drop-down menus and color picker, and supports pointer effects when using a mouse or trackpad on iPad. It also syncs via devices using iCloud and has a brand new widget for iOS 14. 

YarnBuddy is free to use for up to 10 projects. Unlimited projects, as well as the ability to add tags, notes, due date reminders, and row alerts, are available as part of an optional yearly subscription that is also available as a one-time purchase.
